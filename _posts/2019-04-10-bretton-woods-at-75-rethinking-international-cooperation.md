In the aftermath of World War II, the IMF and the World Bank were created to establish a framework for economic cooperation and development that would lead to a more stable and prosperous global economy. Over the last 75 years, the world has indeed improved—incomes and living standards have risen. The benefits, however, remain unequally distributed within many countries, and prosperity is not assured for future generations in many parts of the globe. The seminar will bring together four of the best young academics in the world to discuss how they see the future of international cooperation—and how to further improve international cooperation to strengthen macroeconomic stability and prosperity.
