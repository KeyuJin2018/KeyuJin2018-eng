The relationship between the world's two largest economies, the US and China, has rarely been more tense. China's new Ambassador in Washington Xie Feng has admitted this is a time of "serious difficulties and challenges", but insists he wants to put relations between the two nations back on track. 
And one person who may have some insight into how to do that is Economist and Author Keyu Jin - whose latest book is "The New China Playbook – Beyond Socialism and Capitalism". 

The Associate Professor at the London School of Economics was born in China, educated in the United States and now works between London and Beijing, and explains to Juliet Mann how her background has given her a unique perspective on China’s role in the world, and why the West still needs to improve its understanding of her home country.
