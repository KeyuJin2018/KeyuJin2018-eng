Is China, with its unfair trade policies and shameless theft of intellectual property, an enemy that needs to be reined in? Or is it in the West’s best interests to view China as a strategic partner and aim for mutual respect and cooperation?

We were joined by Keyu Jin, Professor of Economics at LSE; Sir Malcolm Rifkind, politician and former cabinet minister; and Martin Wolf, Chief Economics Commentator at the FT

The event was chaired by BBC News Presenter and the BBC’s first China Editor, Carrie Gracie.
